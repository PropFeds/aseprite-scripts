# aseprite-scripts
Made with 100% mind-boggling garbage collection of Lua.

**terminal_blues_export**: Used to export from master.aseprite of [Terminal Blues](https://github.com/propfeds/terminal-blues/)

**floyd_steinberg_dithering**: Self-explanatory. Leaves about 300 MB of garbage behind. Blame either Lua or Aseprite, not me. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
