# aseprite-scripts
Made with 100% mind-boggling garbage collection of Lua and garbage script execution of Aseprite.

**floyd_steinberg_dithering**: Self-explanatory. Leaves about 300 MB of garbage behind, and does not count as a transaction (cannot undo). Blame Lua and Aseprite, not me. And it still works. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

**terminal_blues_export**: Used to export from master.aseprite of [Terminal Blues](https://github.com/propfeds/terminal-blues/)
